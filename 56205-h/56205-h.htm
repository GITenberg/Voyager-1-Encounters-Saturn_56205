<p>The pictures assembled in this publication are a part of the rich and varied harvest of information
returned by Voyager 1 across nearly a billion miles of interplanetary space. These images are of
great beauty as well as great scientific interest, serving to remind us of the awesome and breathtaking
dimensions of the solar system we inhabit. Voyager is providing intriguing new information which
should help us to understand how the Earth&mdash;and possibly the universe&mdash;was formed. Already there
have been surprises and puzzles that paint a completely new picture of Saturn and its neighborhood,
including the discovery of three new moons, startling information about Saturn&rsquo;s rings, and observation
of the unexpectedly complex structure of Saturn&rsquo;s atmosphere and that of its largest moon, Titan.
It will take years for scientists to assimilate completely the information which is cascading down from
Voyager. What more will this marvel of technology have to tell us before it departs the solar system
to travel endlessly among the stars?</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>No other generation has had the opportunity or the technology to reach beyond our world&mdash;to
see, to touch, to hear the forces that shape our universe. In slightly over two decades, man has ingeniously
explored five distant planets&mdash;and two dozen moons. We have seen their weather and surfaces,
landed on some, probed the atmospheres of others, and listened to their radio noises.</p>
<p>Under the planetary exploration program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
the Voyager Mission, begun in 1972, was designed to explore Jupiter, Saturn, their satellites, rings,
magnetic fields, and interplanetary space. Two automated, reprogrammable spacecraft, Voyagers 1 and
2, were launched in late summer of 1977. Their goals: the outer planets.</p>
<p>Both spacecraft made astounding discoveries in the Jupiter system in 1979&mdash;a thin ring, a thick
ionized sulfur and oxygen torus, an actively volcanic satellite&mdash;these were but a few of the treasures
yielded by the two Jupiter flybys.</p>
<p>Now, Voyager 1 has completed exploration of its final target: the ringed planet Saturn and its
enigmatic giant satellite, Titan. True to the generally unpredictable nature of planetary exploration, the
treasures of the Saturn system far exceeded all expectations. We learned more about Saturn in one
week than in all of recorded history, thanks to one trusty robot no larger than a compact car and to
thousands of diligent and imaginative people.</p>
<p>Both spacecraft carry an assortment of optical, radiometric, and fields and particles sensing
instruments. Taken together, their data present a comprehensive picture of a planetary system&mdash;and
clues to what is happening, what has happened, and what may happen in our universe.</p>
<p>This publication presents the preliminary photographic results of Voyager 1&rsquo;s encounter with
Saturn and its major satellites. Voyager 1 transmitted over 17,500 images in its four months of close
observations of the system. Many of these images have been combined to produce mosaics and color
pictures. Hundreds have yet to be closely examined.</p>
<p>The second Voyager spacecraft will begin its close Saturn observations in early June 1981 and
make its closest approach to the planet&rsquo;s northern hemisphere on August 25. Then, due to its launch
during a period of rare planetary alignment occurring only once every 175 years, Voyager 2 will be
able to continue on to a rendezvous with the seventh planet, Uranus, in January 1986, and perhaps
even the eighth planet, Neptune, in August 1989.</p>
<p>Voyager 1&rsquo;s primary mission is complete. But its usefulness is far from over. As we go about our
daily business, Voyager 1 is searching for another frontier&mdash;the edge of our solar system. In 7 to 15
years, the spacecraft will cross the heliopause&mdash;the farthest reaches of our Sun&rsquo;s magnetic field influence.
Then, high above our ecliptic plane, Voyager 1 will continue its flight toward the star Alpha
Ophiuchus. Eventually, Voyager 1 will be too distant to communicate with Earth and will silently drift
in space forever.</p>

diameter, larger than the distance separating their
orbits, and they are currently approaching one

two years. Such a collision, however, will probably
be averted by orbital changes induced by the satellites&rsquo;
mutual gravitational interactions as they near
one another. The trailing co-orbital satellite, seen in
this photograph, has a very irregular outline (the
Sun is shining from the left). This color composite
was produced from three exposures taken over a

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">The Voyager Mission</span></h2>
<p>Only once every 175 years are the outer
planets aligned in their orbits so that we can take
advantage of gravity-assist trajectories to achieve
encounters with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune on one mission. The gravity-assist
technique uses one planet&rsquo;s gravity field and
motion through space to alter the spacecraft&rsquo;s flight
path and propel it outward toward the next planet.
Voyager 1&rsquo;s trajectory, which was selected to best
view Titan, has now propelled the spacecraft out
of the ecliptic plane, while Voyager 2&rsquo;s path will
remain in this plane to provide future encounters
with Uranus and possibly with Neptune.</p>
<h3 id="c8">MISSION OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>The Voyager Project was approved in June 1972
and had as its mission objectives:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>&#9733; Exploration of the Jupiter and Saturn planetary systems, including their atmospheres, rings, satellites, and magnetospheres</dt>
<dt>&#9733; Comparative analyses of the two systems</dt>
<dt>&#9733; Investigation of the interplanetary medium between Earth and Saturn</dt></dl>
<p>A fourth objective, added in 1976, was to preserve
the possibility of extending the mission to
include an investigation of the planet Uranus and
the interstellar medium.</p>
<p>With the completion of Voyager 1&rsquo;s Saturn flyby,
it is now clear that these objectives will be
achieved.</p>
<h3 id="c9">SPACECRAFT CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
<p>Two identical spacecraft were developed for the
1977 launch opportunity. These marvelous
machines were cleverly designed to survive the
rigors of long voyages in outer space and to deliver
high-quality scientific information required for
detailed understanding of planetary systems. The
spacecraft are both complex&mdash;automatically
responding to their Earth-bound monitors that
remotely control them via radio commands&mdash;and
highly autonomous&mdash;capable of caring for themselves
in many areas through a system of sensors,
computers, and spare equipment. Each spacecraft
functions on about 400 watts of electrical power
which is provided by nuclear generators. Broadcasts
of data across a billion miles to Earth are
accomplished with a spacecraft transmitter power
of only about 25 watts, the amount of energy
required by a small household light bulb.</p>
<p>Voyager&rsquo;s scientific payload was carefully chosen
to observe Saturn over a wide range of wave-lengths
and to measure magnetic fields, charged
particles, and plasma waves.</p>
<h3 id="c10">SATURN ENCOUNTER</h3>

<p>Voyager 1&rsquo;s Saturn encounter period began on
August 22, 1980, at a range of 109 million kilometers
(68 million miles) from the planet. Even at this
great distance, Voyager&rsquo;s images were better than
any from Earth-based telescopes. During the long
encounter period, which extended through
December 19, 1980, continuous observations of
Saturn&rsquo;s realm were carried out by Voyager&rsquo;s instruments.
Voyager 1&rsquo;s flight path through the Saturn
system demanded navigation of the highest precision
to meet three critical targets: (1) a close 4000-kilometer
(2300-mile) flyby and occultation at
Titan, (2) a precise, three-minute time period
when the spacecraft was emerging from occultation
at the same time Earth was in a position to
receive the spacecraft signals passing through the
gap between Saturn and its rings, and (3) a flight
path through the E-Ring at Dione&rsquo;s orbit to assure
safe passage through a zone clear of potentially
dangerous material. To assure these targets were
achieved, small trajectory trim maneuvers were
executed on October 11, 1980, and again on

<p>By October 24, 1980, when Voyager 1 was about
30 million kilometers (19 million miles) from Saturn,
the spacecraft&rsquo;s narrow-angle camera could no
longer capture the planet in a single picture. Thus,
a period of multiple images or mosaics began. By
November 2, 1980, even four-picture mosaics
could no longer cover the rapidly growing scene.
Voyager 1&rsquo;s pace of operations reached an exciting
peak during the near-encounter phase from
November 11 through November 13, 1980. While
still about 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles)
from closest approach to Saturn, Voyager 1
encountered Titan on November 11, 1980, and
then dipped below the ring plane as it accelerated
rapidly toward Saturn. On November 12, 1980,
Voyager 1 came within 124,000 kilometers (77,000
miles) of the cloudtops of Saturn&rsquo;s southern hemisphere,
where Saturn&rsquo;s gravity altered the spacecraft&rsquo;s
course, hurtling the spacecraft upward past
the ring plane. Close observation of Saturn&rsquo;s other
major satellites and its rings were made during this
passage.</p>
<p>From Earth to Saturn, Voyager 1 has traveled in
the ecliptic plane, the plane in which the major
planets orbit. Now, having completed its final planetary
flyby, Voyager 1 is rising above this plane on
a trajectory that will eventually carry it above and
out of the solar system, probably before the end
of this century. As it proceeds, the spacecraft will
return information about the solar wind and magnetic
fields in the far, unexplored reaches of our
solar system and will observe cosmic rays emitted
from the distant stars among which Voyager will
ultimately cruise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Scientific Highlights</span></h2>
<p>Some of the most important information
gathered by Voyager 1 on the Saturn system is
presented pictorially in this publication and is
supplemented here with brief summaries of the
major discoveries, observations, and theories.</p>
<h3 id="c12">SATURN</h3>
<p>Saturn&rsquo;s atmosphere appears similar to Jupiter&rsquo;s,
with alternating dark belts and bright zones, circulating
storm regions, and other dark and light cloud
markings. Saturn&rsquo;s belt and zone system extends to
higher latitudes than those on Jupiter, and all of the
features are muted by a thick atmospheric haze,
perhaps 70 kilometers (40 miles) deep.</p>
<p>Wind speeds up to 1500 kilometers per hour
(900 miles per hour) occur at the equator&mdash;four to
five times faster than any Jovian winds. Temperatures
near the cloudtops range from 86 to 92 kelvins
(-305&deg; to -294&deg; Fahrenheit)&mdash;nearly 60
degrees colder than at Jupiter. Saturn still radiates
about 2.8 times as much heat as it receives from the
Sun. The coolest temperatures are found at the
center of the equatorial zone.</p>
<p>Auroral emissions have been seen near Saturn&rsquo;s
poles, and auroral-type emissions have been seen
in ultraviolet light near the illuminated limb of the
planet.</p>
<p>Lightning bolts have not been seen on Saturn,
but radio emissions typical of lightning discharges
have been recorded. The source of these discharges
is believed to be the rings rather than Saturn&rsquo;s
atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="c13">RINGS</h3>
<p>Hundreds of tiny ringlets&mdash;a few of them elliptical
rather than circular&mdash;comprise the classic A-, B-,
and C-Rings, once thought to be uniform disks of
material. The F-Ring, which was first sighted by
Pioneer 11 in 1979, was observed to be three separate,
intertwined ringlets.</p>
<p>The existence of a D-Ring between the C-Ring
and the planet has been confirmed by observations
during Voyager 1&rsquo;s passage through Saturn&rsquo;s
shadow. The tenuous E-Ring, previously observed
from Earth only when Saturn&rsquo;s rings could be
viewed edge-on (every 15 years), has also been
observed during shadow passage. At least one
other ring has been found between the E- and F-Rings
in Voyager images.</p>
<p>Long, radial, spoke-like features in the B-Ring
were dark when viewed upon approach and bright
when observed after encounter when the spacecraft
looked back toward the planet and the Sun.</p>
<h3 id="c14">NEW SATELLITES</h3>
<p>Voyager 1 photographed six tiny moons, some
that had never been seen before. Satellites 10 and
11, dubbed the &ldquo;co-orbitals,&rdquo; share an orbit 91,000
kilometers (57,000 miles) above Saturn&rsquo;s cloudtops.
The leading satellite has a diameter of about 160
kilometers (100 miles), while the trailing satellite
has an irregular shape, approximately 105 by 65
kilometers (65 by 40 miles).</p>
<p>Little is known about satellites 12, 13, 14, and 15
aside from their orbits and periods. Satellite 12
orbits at the same distance from Saturn as Dione, at
a point about 60 degrees ahead of Dione. Satellites
13 and 14, outside and inside the F-Ring (respectively),
appear to &ldquo;herd&rdquo; this thin ring between
them. Satellite 15 appears to limit the outer edge of
the A-Ring in a similar manner.</p>
<h3 id="c15">INNER SATELLITES</h3>
<p>Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea represent
a body size not previously explored by
spacecraft. They are larger than Jupiter&rsquo;s Amalthea
and Mars&rsquo; Phobos and Deimos, yet smaller than
Mercury, our Moon, or Jupiter&rsquo;s large satellites.
Their diameters range from 390 kilometers (240
miles) for Mimas to 1530 kilometers (950 miles) for
Rhea, and they are probably composed primarily
of water ice.</p>
<p>With the exception of Enceladus, all of these
moons have heavily cratered surfaces, looking
much like the Moon and Mercury. Mimas displays
an impact crater whose diameter is one-fourth that
of the satellite&mdash;such an impact must have nearly
shattered the icy satellite. Tethys has a valley
70 kilometers (40 miles) wide that stretches
800 kilometers (500 miles) across the satellite, an
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
apparent crustal fracture resulting from seismic
activity. Several sinuous valleys, some of which
appear to branch, are visible on Dione&rsquo;s surface.
Both Dione and Rhea have bright, wispy streaks on
their already highly reflective surfaces, perhaps
caused by ice thrown out of craters by meteorite
impacts.</p>
<p>Of the five inner moons, Enceladus appears the
smoothest, but we will have to wait for Voyager 2
to photograph the satellite at greater resolution in
1981. Since the maximum intensity of the E-Ring
occurs near Enceladus&rsquo; orbit, Enceladus may be a
source of E-Ring particles.</p>
<h3 id="c16">TITAN</h3>
<p>Titan is now known to be smaller than Jupiter&rsquo;s
Ganymede. Its diameter is less than 5120 kilometers
(3180 miles), which implies a density twice
that of water ice. A dense, hazy atmosphere at least
400 kilometers (250 miles) thick obscures the surface.
Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-rich
atmosphere (as does Earth), but with
concentrations of hydrocarbons such as methane
(natural gas), ethane, acetylene, ethylene, and
deadly hydrogen cyanide. The haze layers merge
into a darkened hood over the north pole. At the
poles, liquid nitrogen lakes may form. The surface
temperature is probably near 100 kelvins (-280&deg;
Fahrenheit), only slightly warmer than the boiling
point of liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Titan has no appreciable magnetic field and
therefore possesses no large liquid conducting
core. It does, however, supply a small amount of
charged particles to Saturn&rsquo;s magnetosphere.</p>
<p>The southern hemisphere is somewhat brighter
than the northern, perhaps as a result of seasonal
effects.</p>
<h3 id="c17">OUTER SATELLITES</h3>
<p>Of the three known outer satellites, Voyager 1
studied from a distance only Hyperion and Iapetus.
Tiny Phoebe, in its retrograde (clockwise) orbit,
will be studied by Voyager 2 in the summer of
1981. Hyperion and Iapetus are most likely composed
of water ice, although their masses and
densities are uncertain. Iapetus has one bright and
one dark hemisphere. The dark side, which faces
forward as Iapetus circles Saturn, reflects about
one-fifth as much light as the trailing, bright side.</p>
<h3 id="c18">MAGNETOSPHERE</h3>
<p>Although it is only about one-third the size of
Jupiter&rsquo;s magnetosphere, Saturn&rsquo;s magnetosphere is
still an enormous structure, extending nearly two
million kilometers from the planet toward the Sun.
The size of the magnetosphere fluctuates rhythmically
as the flow of charged particles in the solar
wind increases or decreases in intensity. The magnetosphere
can be pushed inside Titan&rsquo;s orbit, so
that at times the satellite finds itself outside of the
magnetosphere altogether.</p>
<p>Charged particles in the planet&rsquo;s magnetosphere
are dragged along by the magnetic field, circling the
planet at Saturn&rsquo;s rotation rate of 10 hours, 39 minutes.
These charged particles whiz by Titan at a
dizzying rate of more than 200 kilometers (120
miles) per second. Titan leaves a motorboat-like
wake in its orbital path.</p>
<p>Extending from the orbit of Titan inward to the
orbit of Rhea, an enormous cloud of uncharged
hydrogen atoms forms a doughnut-shaped torus of
ultraviolet-emitting particles. Because of their neutrality,
these atoms are not towed around by Saturn&rsquo;s
magnetic field.</p>
<p>Close to the planet, Saturn&rsquo;s rings act as an effective
shield or absorber of charged particles. The
rings themselves are apparently substantially
affected in this process, however, as evidenced by
their &ldquo;spokes&rdquo; of fine particles and the lightning-like
electrical discharges attributed to the rings.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
